    <div class = "city"><!--The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by 
                        a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.In the following example we have 
                        three <div> elements with a class attribute with the value of "city". 
                        All of the three <div> elements will be styled equally according to the 
                        .city style definition in the head section-->
    <h2 id = "header2">London</h2>
    <p>London is the capital of England</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "city">
        <h2 id = "header2">Paris</h2>
        <p>Paris is the capital of France</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "city">
        <h2 id = "header2">Tokyo</h2>
        <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan</p>
    </div>
</body>
