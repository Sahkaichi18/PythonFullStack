    <div class = "city"><!--The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by 
                        a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.In the following example we have 
                        three <div> elements with a class attribute with the value of "city". 
                        All of the three <div> elements will be styled equally according to the 
                        .city style definition in the head section-->

    <h2 id = "header2">London</h2><!--The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. 
                                The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.
                                The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. 
                                It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.
                                The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. 
                                Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.
                                In the following example we have an <h1> element that points to the id name "myHeader". 
                                This <h1> element will be styled according to the #myHeader style definition in the head section-->
    <p>London is the capital of England</p>
    </div>


    <div class = "city">
        <h2 id = "header2">Paris</h2>
        <p>Paris is the capital of France</p>
    </div>

    
    <div class = "city">
